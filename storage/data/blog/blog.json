In the following decades, mouse technology advanced\n                                            significantly, starting with the introduction of a ball for movement\n                                            tracking and later evolving into optical and laser sensors.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <img alt=\"wooden mouse\"\n                                             style=\"height: 250px;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\"\n                                             src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/the_mouse_ball/wooden_mouse.jpg\"/>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>The Ball Mouse</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first ball mouse was developed in 1972 by Bill\n                                            English, a colleague of Douglas Engelbart. Unlike Engelbart's original\n                                            mouse, which relied on two wheels, the ball mouse used a rolling ball to\n                                            detect movement, making it more versatile and easier to use.</p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>How the Ball Mouse Worked</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The ball inside the mouse was typically made of\n                                            rubber and could rotate in any direction. As the user moved the mouse across\n                                            a surface, the ball rolled and rotated. This rotation was transmitted to two\n                                            rollers that tracked movement along the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y)\n                                            axes. The rollers converted the ball's mechanical motion into electrical\n                                            signals, which were then translated into cursor movement on the computer\n                                            screen.</p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <img alt=\"mouse sketch\"\n                                             style=\"height: 250px;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\"\n                                             src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/the_mouse_ball/mouse_sketch.png\"/>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This ball mechanism made the mouse more practical,\n                                            as it could detect movement in any direction without restrictions. It was\n                                            also more durable and reliable than the earlier wheel-based mice, which\n                                            often encountered alignment and calibration issues. The ball mouse became\n                                            the dominant design for many years, until the advent of optical and laser\n                                            mice that no longer required physical contact with a surface.</p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <img alt=\"mouse circuit\"\n                                             style=\"height: 250px;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\"\n                                             src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/the_mouse_ball/mouse_circuit.jpg\"/>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>Limitations of Ball Mice</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Despite their success, ball mice had several\n                                            limitations that eventually led to their replacement by optical and laser\n                                            mice.</p>\n\n                                        <ol>\n                                            <li style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                                <b>Need for Cleaning: </b>The ball would collect dust, dirt, and debris\n                                                as it rolled across surfaces.

Surfaces that were too\n                                                slick, rough, or glossy could interfere with the ball’s ability to roll\n                                                properly, limiting its effectiveness.

Instead of the traditional approach to data management\n                                            where records can be updated or overwritten, immutable databases append\n                                            changes, maintaining a verifiable and permanent record of all transactions\n                                            or updates.</p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>The Core Concept of Immutability</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Immutability in databases originates from the\n                                            principle of \"write-once-read-many\" (WORM). Unlike traditional relational or\n                                            non-relational databases, immutable databases use data structures that\n                                            maintain the history of data. This means that every state of the database is\n                                            preserved, and the system creates a new version of the data for every\n                                            modification.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The immutable model offers several key\n                                            advantages:</p>\n\n                                        <ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            <li><strong>Auditability</strong>: Since data cannot be overwritten or\n                                                deleted, immutable databases create a complete, verifiable history of\n                                                changes. This feature is particularly beneficial for industries like\n                                                finance, healthcare, and legal systems, where transparency and\n                                                accountability are paramount.\n                                            </li>\n                                            <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Immutable databases significantly\n                                                reduce the risk of malicious data tampering.

It allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, enabling a tree structure to represent complex object hierarchies.</p>\n                          <p>\n                            The Composite Design Pattern consists of three pillars:\n                            <ul>\n                              <li>When your application requires a tree structure to represent hierarchies of objects.</li>\n                              <li>When you want to treat individual objects and composite objects uniformly.</li>\n                              <li>When operations on nodes in a hierarchy should work in the same way for leaves and composites.</li>\n                            </ul>                            \n                          </p>\n                          <p>\n                            You can use the Composite Design Pattern when your application requires a tree structure to represent hierarchies of objects, when you want to treat individual objects and composite objects uniformly, or when operations on nodes in a hierarchy should work in the same way for leaves and composites.\n                          </p>\n                          <h4>UML</h4>\n                          <img src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/composite-pattern-1.png\" />\n                          <h4>Example In Java</h4>\n                          <img src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/composite-pattern-java.png\" />\n                          <h4>Example In Python</h4>\n                          <img src=\"https://tkouleris.eu/img/blog/composite-pattern-python.png\" />\n                          <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of the Pattern</h4>\n                          <p>The Composite Design Pattern provides an elegant way to represent and work with tree structures. It simplifies client code by allowing uniform treatment of both individual (leaf) and composite objects. This uniformity makes it easier to perform operations on entire hierarchies without needing to distinguish between leaf and composite objects explicitly. Furthermore, the pattern promotes flexibility by enabling new types of components to be introduced with minimal changes to existing code, making the design more extensible and easier to maintain.</p>\n                          <p>However, the pattern is not without its downsides. Managing complex component hierarchies can add overhead, especially if the tree structure is large or frequently modified. Additionally, the uniform treatment of objects might lead to overly generic interfaces that don’t adequately represent specific behaviors of individual components. If the application does not naturally require a hierarchical structure, implementing the Composite Pattern can result in unnecessary complexity.</p>\n                          <h4>Final</h4>\n                          <p>The Composite Design Pattern simplifies the management of complex hierarchical object structures. Whether working in Java or Python, implementing this pattern can significantly enhance code reusability and maintainability. By abstracting operations and managing components uniformly, you can handle intricate part-whole relationships effectively.</p>\n                          <p>The Composite Design Pattern simplifies the management of complex hierarchical object structures.

        "content":"<p>A conspiracy theory I came up with last night goes as follows: free software and open-source software exist so that large corporations can use software they would otherwise have to spend significant amounts of money to purchase or develop.</p><p>The truth is that software companies like Microsoft have often fought against open-source and free software. But is that enough to claim that the philosophy of free code (from now on, by \"free code,\" I mean both free software and open-source software) doesn't \"suit\" them? Certainly, it doesn't benefit a company directly if a new competitor emerges for its office suite, such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice, especially if the company sells its own suite. However, this isn't the software we’re talking about here.</p><p>Let’s consider software like Linux. For a company like Microsoft to develop such software would require significant time and money. Of course, they could invest some funds to make it \"compatible\" with other software they sell, but even then, the cost wouldn't be the same. Especially if they use Linux on some of their cloud platforms, the cost for the company is almost zero, and they would keep most of the revenue from the service, perhaps only deducting maintenance costs.</p><p>Another example is the Edge browser. Microsoft cleverly used the open-source Chromium code to release its own browser, leaving behind the outdated Internet Explorer. Creating a new browser from scratch with the security and features Google had developed would have been difficult and costly.</p><p>Perhaps this is why, in recent years, companies have stopped fighting against free code and joined the game instead. It has become evident that free code benefits companies—especially large corporations. How else could Microsoft have developed Copilot without access to a vast pool of code to train its new tool?</p><p>Thus, it seems that free code might be a grand \"conspiracy\" to allow large companies access to cheaper software—or even code—so they can generate greater profits at the lowest possible cost. Of course, this is just a conspiracy theory, one of those fleeting thoughts that come to you just before drifting off to sleep, and its value is about as significant as that of Internet Explorer.</p>",

They are fundamental to computer science, and\n                                            the differences between them mainly lie in their time complexity and space\n                                            complexity, which determine their suitability for handling larger\n                                            datasets.</p><br/>\n                                        <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n                                            The simplest and, at the same time, the worst sorting algorithm is Bubble\n                                            Sort. In Bubble Sort, we start from the beginning of the dataset and compare\n                                            the first two elements. The smaller one is placed first, and the larger one\n                                            second. Then, we compare the next two elements and repeat the process.

Once a full pass is complete, the\n                                            process is repeated from the start until the dataset is fully sorted.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n                                            For example, consider the array [10, 4, 5, 8, 0]. To execute the algorithm:\n\n                                            Compare 10 with 4. Since 4 is smaller, the array becomes [4, 10, 5, 8, 0].\n                                            Compare 10 with 5.

This makes the code harder to read and more difficult to\n                                            understand.</p>\n                                        <b>A Better Approach:</b>\n                                        <pre><code>\nif not condition1:\n    return\n\nif not condition2:\n    return\n\nif not condition3:\n    return\n\n# Do something\n\n                                        </code></pre>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            To make the above code more readable, we created a helper function and\n                                            utilized the early return technique. If data is missing, we return. If the\n                                            user is inactive, we return. If the user’s profile doesn’t exist, we return.\n                                            This way, the code becomes more readable and easier for the reader to follow\n                                            without overloading their memory.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <h3>2. Extract Variable Checks into Functions</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            In many cases, variable checks can make code harder to read, requiring you\n                                            to keep track of what each variable does. A simple way to make your code\n                                            read like plain text is to extract variable checks into functions. For\n                                            example:\n                                        </p>\n\n                                        <b>Before:</b>\n                                        <pre><code>\nif data.users.length > 0:\n    # Do something\n\n                                        </code></pre>\n                                        <b>After:</b>\n                                        <pre><code>\ndef has_users(data):\n    return len(data.users) > 0\n\nif has_users(data):\n    # Do something\n\n                                        </code></pre>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            In the above block, we created the has_users function. This allows the\n                                            reader to interpret the code as “if the data has users” rather than\n                                            deciphering what data.users.length means.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <h3>3. Avoid Code Duplication</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            In programming, it’s important not to write the same code repeatedly. This\n                                            can simplify future changes to the code. For example, what if you needed to\n                                            change the text from \"User is active and\" to \"Client is available and\"?\n                                            While this might only appear in two lines in a small example, in a\n                                            real-world application, such a string might be duplicated across 10 or 20\n                                            places. You’d need to find and modify the string in all of those instances.\n                                            Instead, you can use a function to handle this centrally.\n                                        </p>\n\n                                        Example:\n                                        <pre><code>\ndef log_user_status(user):\n    print(f\"{user.name} is active and {user.status}\")\n\n                                        </code></pre>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            By using this function, you only need to update the logic in one place if\n                                            changes are required.</p><br/>\n                                        <h3>Final Code with All Three Improvements:</h3>\n                                        <pre><code>\ndef has_users(data):\n    return len(data.users) > 0\n\ndef log_user_status(user):\n    print(f\"{user.name} is active and {user.status}\")\n\ndef process_data(data):\n    if not data:\n        return\n\n    if not data.is_active:\n        return\n\n    if not has_users(data):\n        return\n\n    for user in data.users:\n        log_user_status(user)\n\n                                        </code></pre>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>Why These Rules Are Important</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            These three rules are crucial for writing readable code and making future\n                                            changes easier. Even code we wrote today might be hard to remember after\n                                            three years when modifications are required. If we don’t structure the code\n                                            to be navigable and readable, we will spend more time developing new\n                                            features or fixing bugs.</p>",

Today, they have been replaced by newer\n                                            technologies, such as PCI and PCIe.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>What Are ISA Slots?</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            ISA slots are expansion slots found on motherboards that were primarily used during the 1980s and 1990s to connect external\n                                            cards and devices to computers. These cards included devices such as sound cards, graphics cards, network cards, and controllers\n                                            for external peripherals like printers and hard drives.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            Introduced in 1981 by IBM with the debut of the IBM PC, ISA architecture aimed to standardize the connection of additional\n                                            components inside the computer. This standardized architecture enabled widespread adoption by hardware manufacturers, making\n                                            it the dominant solution of its time.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>The Technology</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            The first version of ISA slots was 8-bit, meaning they could transfer data over 8-bit-wide paths. While sufficient for early\n                                            personal computers, growing demands highlighted the need for faster and wider data pathways. In response, the 16-bit version\n                                            of ISA was introduced in 1984, allowing more efficient data transfers and support for more demanding expansion cards.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            ISA slots had a relatively slow data transfer rate, ranging from 1 to 8 MB/s depending on the version. This slow speed became\n                                            a significant drawback as modern devices began requiring higher performance and faster data rates.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>The Use of ISA Slots</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            At their peak, ISA slots were the standard medium for connecting various peripheral devices. Numerous expansion cards, such\n                                            as Sound Blaster audio cards, graphics cards, SCSI controllers, and network cards, were designed for ISA slots.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            Their popularity stemmed from their broad compatibility and widespread support for many devices. However, as computers became\n                                            more powerful and device performance demands increased, the limitations of ISA technology became increasingly apparent.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>The Decline of ISA Slots</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            By the 1990s, ISA technology began to show its limitations as computers grew more powerful and user demands escalated.\n                                            Manufacturers started seeking alternatives offering better performance. This led to the introduction of PCI (Peripheral\n                                            Component Interconnect) in 1991, which provided significantly faster speeds and superior performance compared to ISA. PCI\n                                            slots allowed the connection of faster and more efficient devices, gradually rendering ISA obsolete.\n                                        </p><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            By the late 1990s, PCI slots had almost completely replaced ISA slots in most personal computers. Some motherboards continued\n                                            to include ISA slots into the early 2000s for compatibility with older devices, but their use eventually faded.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>Legacy and Significance</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                                            ISA slots played a pivotal role in the development of personal computers, enabling the expansion of their capabilities with\n                                            new devices and technologies.

We can also, for\n                                            free or with a subscription, listen to almost any album or perhaps even the\n                                            entire discography of any band or artist. But 25 years ago, things were not\n                                            like this.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The cassette was a technology simple in its\n                                            conception. It was a small plastic casing containing a magnetic tape, on\n                                            which sound could be recorded, such as music, speech, or other sounds. The\n                                            tape was wound around two spools, and by moving the tape through the\n                                            cassette, sound could be recorded or played back.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">There were many uses for it. From listening to\n                                            music recorded by a studio to capturing the inarticulate screams you made\n                                            with your friends to pass the time. However, the most common use was to make\n                                            a mixtape of different songs, which usually expressed feelings for someone\n                                            else and was intended as a gift for that person.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">I admit that I never bought an original cassette\n                                            with music, because another common practice was to copy entire albums for\n                                            our friends, and they would do the same for others. Obviously, this was\n                                            something the record companies didn't want, but there was no technology at\n                                            the time to stop it.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>The Use of Cassettes in Computers</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another use of cassettes was with computers. In\n                                            the 1980s, there was a significant rise in the home computer market. One of\n                                            the storage mediums... who am I kidding? The best way to play a game was to\n                                            find a pirated cassette with the game on it. There were external devices\n                                            that would read the magnetic tape of the cassette and transfer the data to\n                                            the computer's memory. Just like with floppy disks, except instead of\n                                            reading a magnetic disk, they read a magnetic tape.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>The Walkman</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, without the cassette, we would never have\n                                            been able to carry music with us everywhere. So, in the late 70s, Sony gave\n                                            us a groundbreaking invention—the Walkman. I won't write much here since the\n                                            Walkman and its derivatives deserve an article of their own, but it's\n                                            important to note that the small size of the cassette helped in the\n                                            development of the Walkman. It certainly wouldn’t have been as easy to carry\n                                            around a portable turntable to listen to \"Battery\" by Metallica.</p><br/>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although the audio cassette was hugely popular in\n                                            the 1980s and 1990s, with the rise of CDs and digital formats, its use\n                                            gradually declined. However, it remains a symbol of the analog era and music\n                                            culture.</p><br/>",

These are usually either low self-esteem, fear of\n                                            the unknown, or arrogance, which create the problems. Human characteristics\n                                            that, as human experience has shown, when we master them, we make the world\n                                            better.</p>\n\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>1. I need to learn everything to be a good programmer</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This can happen when you start your journey as a\n                                            programmer. Slightly influenced by the countless movies showing programmers\n                                            as centers of knowledge and wisdom, and a bit by the huge amount of\n                                            technologies out there, you think you're too insignificant to become a\n                                            programmer or that you need to dedicate your life exclusively to it.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">When I finished school and was trying to find my\n                                            first job as a programmer, I read all the job listings and the skills\n                                            potential employers wanted me to have, and I broke into a cold sweat.\n                                            Technologies I had never heard of, terminology that was unknown and\n                                            incomprehensible. This was the reason I didn’t continue as a professional\n                                            programmer at that time and chose something simpler, like network\n                                            technician.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, if I had overcome my fears back then and\n                                            managed to find a job as a programmer, I would have faced another problem\n                                            that many beginners face—the imposter syndrome.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">And indeed, when I started working as a programmer\n                                            in 2016, for two years I thought I was just lucky and that soon they would\n                                            discover how incompetent I was and fire me. This anxiety made me try to\n                                            learn as much as possible. Learn WordPress, learn JavaScript, learn Laravel,\n                                            learn C and C++ (as if I needed them as a web developer), learn the\n                                            significance of every new buzzword I saw in the programming world.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fortunately, I soon realized that all I needed to\n                                            do was focus my attention on one language, one framework, and learn the\n                                            basic concepts and how I could apply them in my everyday work as a\n                                            programmer.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">As programmers, we need to understand that we\n                                            can't learn everything. Programming languages, frameworks, and technologies\n                                            are so numerous out there that even two lifetimes wouldn’t be enough to\n                                            learn them all. We only need to understand that all we need to learn are the\n                                            basics, the fundamentals. The client-server model, recursion, SOLID, design\n                                            patterns. These concepts are tied to a single technology or language but can\n                                            be applied across most technologies and languages.</p>\n\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>2. I know everything, I am the best programmer</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Fortunately, I have never met a programmer with\n                                            the arrogant behavior of the all-knowing who is always right. However, it is\n                                            another human behavior that we encounter in our daily lives, and sooner or\n                                            later, we will encounter it in our profession as well.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">At some point, we may acquire so much programming\n                                            knowledge that we begin to believe we are something special. This may even\n                                            be reinforced if, in the environment you work in, you always have the\n                                            answers and help others with their problems. However, it’s good not to have\n                                            illusions.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">We must always have an open mind and listen to the\n                                            opinion of someone who may not have the experience or the same knowledge as\n                                            we do. A good idea can come even from our local newsagent, who might have\n                                            nothing to do with programming. Rejecting an idea to insist on our own\n                                            superiority helps no one.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">More important than being right is the ability to\n                                            collaborate with others, and this cannot be done if you believe you are\n                                            always right or that your opinion is better than others. Collaboration\n                                            solves problems, and that's the only thing we want to do as programmers—to\n                                            solve problems.</p>\n\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3>3. This problem is impossible to solve, no one has ever solved it</h3>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let’s say you’ve been working as a programmer for\n                                            some years, you have self-confidence (but not arrogance), and you are\n                                            presented with a problem you’ve never encountered before. It seems\n                                            impossible to implement, and you reject it. Congratulations, you just missed\n                                            an opportunity to become a better programmer.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">I understand the fear someone might have about the\n                                            unknown, but a programmer doesn’t exist to create simple CRUD applications.\n                                            After all, even an AI could do that today. A programmer is for the tough\n                                            problems. And these are the ones that improve him and make him better.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Certainly, not all problems can be solved, but we\n                                            shouldn’t dismiss even the attempt to solve them. Before you say that you\n                                            cannot solve this problem, give it a try. See if others have solved it or\n                                            solved part of it. Ask another programmer if they have any ideas. Only when\n                                            you reach an absolute dead end should you admit defeat. It’s not a bad\n                                            thing. Then say that at this moment, this problem cannot be solved by\n                                            me.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The process of solving it, or even admitting\n                                            defeat, takes you a step forward. It’s no small thing to break out of a\n                                            routine of creating simple CRUD applications and do what you were made\n                                            for—to solve real problems.</p>",

Recently, the content\n                                            has shifted towards discussion-type videos on topics relevant to developers in the workplace.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@CodeGRrow\" target=\"_blank\"> <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">CodeGRow</h3></a>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            A relatively new channel that I stumbled upon during a TikTok infinite scroll session, and I’ve been following it ever since.\n                                            The content is primarily practical, focusing on tutorials.

        "content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            In the minds of many, video games are still seen as something that only kids have the \"right\" to enjoy. For adults, they are often considered a waste of time. But is that really true?\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            Video games have evolved from two white pixels on a screen in the 1980s to today’s complex graphics with storylines that even Hollywood’s best screenwriters would envy. The depth and narrative quality of many modern games make it hard to dismiss them as mere children’s toys. In fact, there are several games based on real events that provide players with an opportunity to learn about human history while having fun.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            If I had to answer the question of whether games are a waste of time with a single word, my answer would be <strong>no</strong>. But what exactly constitutes a waste of time? For example, someone might argue that reading books isn’t a waste of time, and society generally accepts that view. But the real question is: what books are being read? If someone reads books like <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, one could objectively say it’s a waste of time since it neither produces anything nor teaches anything new.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            However, for every individual, even a seemingly trivial book, movie, or game can have meaning in their life. These are forms of entertainment, and depending on their content, they can either be truly enriching or remain at the level of simple amusement. Even lighthearted entertainment, though, is essential for some people to move forward in life with a little more ease.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            There are times when we simply want to rest—to escape a bit without thinking, learning, or creating something. We just want to \"kill\" some time to relax. I believe this need is so essential that the so-called \"wasted\" time actually becomes an important tool for boosting productivity and creativity later on. From this perspective, it’s not wasted or lost time but rather a method to recharge and improve oneself.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">When Can Something Be Considered a Waste of Time?</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            For me, wasted time is when you start something beneficial to you, do it once, twice, or three times, and then quit. For instance, say you decide to join a gym. You go three times, spending six hours of your life, but your body doesn’t show any change. Even then, it’s not necessarily wasted time if you do it consciously, recognizing that you’re simply taking some time to relax without fooling yourself into thinking you’re improving your fitness.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            Wasted time, in my view, is when someone takes actions toward achieving a goal but gives up after a few attempts.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Role of Addiction in Wasting Time</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            Another case where something can be considered a waste of time is addiction. Modern technology demands our attention. Our attention is the currency for apps like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and similar platforms. These apps are designed to be addictive, making it easy to lose three hours without achieving anything, without even having fun, or recharging your mind. You’re simply inactive. Knowing when to stop scrolling is crucial.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Subjectivity and Personal Perspective</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n                                            Ultimately, all of this is subjective. No one can define with precision what constitutes a waste of time for someone else. It all depends on the timing, the motivations, and the goals of the individual. Video games are not inherently a waste of time because they mean something different to everyone.\n                                        </p>",

Up\n                                            until about 2002, having internet required not only a landline but also an\n                                            internet subscription, which provided you with a combination of username,\n                                            password, a phone number, and of course, a modem to connect. From 2002\n                                            onwards (at least that’s when I noticed it), prepaid internet time cards\n                                            became available. These cards provided a phone number and a code, which,\n                                            with your modem, allowed you to connect to the internet.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            For those unfamiliar with how modems worked, it might sound strange that you\n                                            needed a phone number. The modem had to dial the phone number provided by\n                                            the internet service provider (ISP), which routed your connection to another\n                                            modem/server. Your modem and the ISP’s modem/server negotiated how the\n                                            signal would be transmitted via the phone line (the piercing sound you may\n                                            have heard was actually this negotiation), and then your computer became\n                                            part of the ISP’s network.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>ADSL Modem: Between Two Worlds</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            In the summer of 2005, I got ADSL at home for the first time. It came as\n                                            part of an \"ADSL in a Box\" kit that included everything needed for the\n                                            setup, such as documents to send to the provider (in this case, Forthnet)\n                                            and an ADSL modem. This was a transitional period where even ISPs were\n                                            unsure how users would handle ADSL. This was because the ADSL modem was a\n                                            device that you connected to your computer via USB, plugged the phone line\n                                            into the modem, and used a Windows application to connect to the internet.\n                                            Naturally, only one person could use the internet at a time—unless you took\n                                            the time to figure out how to share the connection with other devices.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            Soon after, ADSL modem-routers emerged, offering both options: you could\n                                            connect the router as you would today or use the modem via USB with a\n                                            specific application. Personally, I never used the modem functionality of a\n                                            modem-router. Three months after my first ADSL connection, I bought a US\n                                            Robotics router so I could connect to the internet easily with Linux.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>Speed of Light</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            The first time I used the internet from home was around 2001.

He had given it to me because he had upgraded to the peak modem of\n                                            the era: 56Kbps.\n                                        </p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            While these speeds seem laughable today, back then, the internet's demands\n                                            weren’t exceedingly high. To give some perspective, the lowest ADSL speed at\n                                            the time was 384Kbps—nearly seven times faster than a 56Kbps modem but still\n                                            62 times slower than the maximum ADSL speed today, which now seems sluggish.\n                                        </p><br/>\n\n                                        <h3>Epilogue</h3>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            Many years have passed, and we’ve grown accustomed to uninterrupted internet\n                                            access.

IBM was the first company\n                                            to develop and introduce the floppy disk in 1967, although its official\n                                            release occurred in 1971. The first floppy disk was 8 inches in diameter and\n                                            had a capacity of just 80 KB. Its major innovation was the ability to\n                                            rewrite data, a significant leap forward compared to the magnetic tapes used\n                                            at the time.\n                                        </p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            The floppy disk evolved rapidly.

This smaller, more practical format offered capacities ranging\n                                            from 110 KB to 1.2 MB. These disks were widely successful throughout the\n                                            1980s and 1990s, serving as the primary medium for software installation and\n                                            data transfer.\n                                        </p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n                                            A major upgrade came in 1984 with Sony’s 3.5-inch floppy disk.

The floppy disk was a thin, flexible plastic object, either 3.5 inches or 5.25 inches in size, containing a magnetic disk inside its casing. Its maximum storage capacity was 1.44 MB—barely enough to hold even one MP3 song. Back then, however, storage needs were much less demanding than they are today.",

Thus, programming\n                                            entered Bram's life early on through the then-famous programming language\n                                            BASIC, which was widely used for coding at the time.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, his greatest contribution to computer\n                                            science came much later. It was a time when the internet was gradually\n                                            becoming a part of everyone’s life. Back then, internet speeds were slow,\n                                            file sizes were large, and the demand for downloads was even greater. While\n                                            there were platforms like KaZaA for file transfers (both legal and illegal),\n                                            and FTP for mainly legal downloads, a significant problem persisted. If the\n                                            files were large and the demand for downloads high, as mentioned earlier,\n                                            download speeds would drop dramatically.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">To solve this problem, Cohen came up with an idea\n                                            that could be described as \"communistic.\" Anyone who wanted a file could\n                                            obtain it from multiple sources simultaneously. For example, if Byron and\n                                            Alice had the file and Kostas wanted to download it, he could download parts\n                                            of the file from both Byron and Alice at the same time. Once Kostas\n                                            completed his download and had the file on his disk, he would then become a\n                                            third node from which others could download the file.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This approach distributed the load among all those\n                                            who had the file, improving download speeds. To achieve this, Cohen invented\n                                            BitTorrent. Essentially, BitTorrent is a small file that contains\n                                            information about where someone can find the file they want to download.\n                                            Using the earlier example, Kostas would first download this small file,\n                                            which would contain details about Byron and Alice. Once Kostas completed the\n                                            download, his information would also be added to the file for the next\n                                            person seeking the same download.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The decentralized technology Cohen created is\n                                            still widely used today. It made transferring movies and music easier and\n                                            led to the rise of websites like The Pirate Bay.</p>",

Initially, they were thought to be a group of\n                                            hackers aiming to attack the Church of Scientology, which was attempting to\n                                            intimidate people into removing videos that exposed the church's true\n                                            nature.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">But where did the Anonymous originate? Those less\n                                            familiar with internet culture might point to the obvious explanation widely\n                                            circulated by the media—that they emerged from the site 4chan. While this is\n                                            not incorrect, the true roots of the Anonymous go much further back, tied to\n                                            the culture and ideology of hackers.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This ideology had existed almost from the\n                                            beginning. It traces back to the 1970s and 1980s, when hackers conducted\n                                            their early experiments in garages and freely shared information with the\n                                            world. The methods for creating new projects were openly available—either by\n                                            asking the creator directly or, later on, by reading Bulletin Board Systems\n                                            (BBS), which preserved such knowledge.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This approach shaped the entire field of computer\n                                            science. Steve Wozniak showcased the first personal computer and met Steve\n                                            Jobs, with whom he would later found Apple. Other hackers, like Captain\n                                            Crunch, demonstrated techniques such as making free calls through the\n                                            American telephone system, uncovering and sharing the methods with\n                                            others.</p><br/>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6TjjE8NHV0?si=0IPWfgZtyWEX8kZ7\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">It made no sense to those hackers to create\n                                            something they couldn’t share with others. They believed that information\n                                            should be free. This belief motivated them to develop new technologies.\n                                            Later, as networks began to emerge—not yet for the masses but for the few\n                                            passionate about technology—many found ways to access restricted information\n                                            and share it widely.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">These were the first hackers who became known to\n                                            the public, often seen as thieves. However, in 1986, Mentor, one of the most\n                                            renowned hackers today, wrote the <em>Hacker Manifesto</em>. In it, he made\n                                            it clear that hackers were not rebellious teenagers aiming to destroy the\n                                            world. They were ordinary people exploring new technologies and advocating\n                                            for free access to information. They didn’t care about religion, gender, or\n                                            race. Remaining anonymous behind their keyboards, they exchanged ideas and\n                                            knowledge.</p>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvK7V7U5Mck?si=cegC5Xba35weIjcO\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">This core idea of freedom of speech, the\n                                            dissemination of information, and human knowledge is the driving force for\n                                            all hackers around the world. This freedom gave rise to free software,\n                                            Linux, and much of the technology we use today.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">All this freedom of speech finds fertile ground on\n                                            the internet. Anyone can express their opinion, conceal their identity, or\n                                            joke around. What surfaces on the internet—whether an idea, a technology, or\n                                            a meme—emerges from the democratic process that is inherent in the nature of\n                                            the internet.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">With this in mind, the Anonymous originated from\n                                            4chan, a controversial site, when someone in power tried to silence the\n                                            voices of the internet. Someone decided to impose silence on a medium that\n                                            cannot be silenced. Thus, the Anonymous began there, motivated by the\n                                            principle of freedom of speech.

Their primary method of protest\n                                            involves DDoS attacks—attacks where the goal is to overwhelm a server with\n                                            numerous requests, causing it to crash. In the real world, this is\n                                            comparable to gathering in Syntagma Square one afternoon with like-minded\n                                            individuals to protest pension reforms.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">It becomes clear that their basic methodology does\n                                            not require technical expertise but rather numbers. Therefore, anyone can be\n                                            part of the Anonymous. Of course, not all members are without the necessary\n                                            technical skills. Some, particularly those who bring hidden information\n                                            about governments and corporations to light via WikiLeaks, possess the\n                                            requisite expertise. However, the essence remains that anyone can protest\n                                            against injustice on the internet.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The future of the Anonymous is unknown because\n                                            they have no leadership. They operate anarchically, without leaders, which\n                                            aligns perfectly with hacking culture. No one knows what lies ahead or how\n                                            long they will continue to exist. Nevertheless, they remain a distinctive\n                                            part of computer science. Their most recent intervention was a letter to\n                                            Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the war in Palestine.</p>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCbKv9yiLiQ?si=ONWl5O64PpAaPhMp\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>",

At the time, he was\n                                            still a student, with no idea that he would change the world with this small\n                                            personal project, which he began as an effort to learn assembly language for\n                                            the 8086.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Born in Finland, his first encounter with\n                                            computers came at the age of 11, using a Commodore VIC 20. He started coding\n                                            in BASIC. During his university studies, he was taught by Andrew Tanenbaum,\n                                            a name familiar to anyone who has studied computer science due to his hefty\n                                            books on networks and operating systems. Without him, Torvalds would never\n                                            have been inspired to start Linux, as his initial work was based on Minix,\n                                            an operating system developed by Tanenbaum in 1987.</p><br/>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOXeXauRAm0?si=N0zTioBCxZMobPP9\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The original name he wanted to give his operating\n                                            system was Freax, but thankfully, the FTP administrator who hosted the first\n                                            kernel of the system changed it to the now well-known Linux.</p>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Linux has since changed the course of computing,\n                                            as most servers and mobile phones run some version of its kernel. However,\n                                            it didn’t stop there. The need to manage the changes made by kernel\n                                            developers led Torvalds to another major achievement: the creation of the\n                                            widely used Git.

One of these\n                                            individuals, known primarily in the gaming community, is John Carmack.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">You may not recognize his name, but you’ve likely\n                                            used one of his creations—his games. <i>Commander Keen</i>, <i>Wolfenstein\n                                                3D</i>, <i>Doom</i>, and <i>Quake</i> are just a few of his works. But\n                                            you might wonder, what does gaming have to do with computer science? The\n                                            answer is simple: games brought computers into most households.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until the mid-'90s, PCs were an expensive and\n                                            time-consuming hobby. In most parts of the world, people were reluctant to\n                                            spend so much money on gaming when consoles were far better suited to the\n                                            task. However, when <i>DOOM</i> debuted on PCs, it was revolutionary.\n                                            Consoles couldn’t match its capabilities, and the only way to experience its\n                                            full potential was on a PC. This increased demand, which in turn drove\n                                            prices down.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before Carmack reached the greatness of\n                                            <i>DOOM</i>, he wrote countless lines of code. He began developing his first\n                                            games for a magazine, where he met John Romero. At that time, smooth\n                                            scrolling on PCs was something no one had achieved, and NES games were\n                                            envied for their fluid scrolling. Unlike PCs, which were primarily designed\n                                            for tasks like Excel, NES consoles had the hardware to accomplish this.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Carmack struggled but ultimately succeeded in\n                                            achieving smooth scrolling even on a PC. He was so excited about this\n                                            breakthrough that his first demo was the initial level from <i>Super Mario\n                                                Bros. 3</i>. He thought Nintendo would be interested, so he showed them\n                                            the demo, hoping to secure permission to create <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>\n                                            for PCs. However, Nintendo declined, wanting Mario to appear only on their\n                                            hardware for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Carmack’s achievement, smooth scrolling, led to\n                                            the creation of a new PC hero: <i>Commander Keen</i>. In this game, Carmack\n                                            utilized the technology he had developed, forever changing the landscape of\n                                            gaming on PCs.</p><br/>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMbFExwqMYc?si=g8y5uUuTcs_P50Jm\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, this first achievement did not satisfy\n                                            his hunger, and soon gamers were enjoying a new game titled <i>Wolfenstein\n                                                3D</i>. In it, Carmack gave players the illusion of three-dimensional\n                                            space by using raycasting technology. This technique relies on a 2D map of\n                                            the area the player is navigating, and based on the player’s position and\n                                            viewing direction, it calculates distances and renders walls in the correct\n                                            proportions to appear 3D.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">His next project would leave the entire world in\n                                            awe and forever change gaming and computers. The phenomenon of <i>DOOM</i>\n                                            in 1992 was the result of implementing in real code a method that had\n                                            existed since the 1960s, known as Binary Space Partitioning (BSP). Using\n                                            this technology, he created yet another 3D game—though not truly 3D—that\n                                            left everyone speechless.</p>\n                                        <br/>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTRzfKh4Tg0?si=F-rtbQ31BfSSe9BD\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, such a persistent programmer would\n                                            certainly not want to settle for something that was 3D but not truly 3D. So,\n                                            for the first time in 1996, with Carmack's blessing and his equally blessed\n                                            code, we all saw what true 3D on a PC really meant.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">With the money he earned from his discoveries, he\n                                            founded an aerospace company and collaborated with NASA. Recently, he has\n                                            been focused on virtual reality and the potential of Oculus Rift.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">John Carmack writes code non-stop. In fact, legend\n                                            has it that his ideal vacation is when he can isolate himself in a room with\n                                            his computer, so he can write code undisturbed.</p>\n\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">He is a strong advocate for open-source software,\n                                            and many of his creations have become open-source, allowing them to live on\n                                            for 20+ years after their creation. To understand what I mean, one can\n                                            simply play <i>Brutal Doom</i>.</p><br/>\n                                        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\n                                                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IinYnj5CsPE?si=NW7JZa1CYC1Y2giL\"\n                                                title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\"\n                                                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n                                                referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"\n                                                allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                                        <br/><br/>\n                                        <p style=\"text-align:justify\">At 47, he still has plenty of time to provide us\n                                            with more of his algorithmic achievements, especially in the field of\n                                            virtual reality, which he has been exploring in recent years.</p>",
