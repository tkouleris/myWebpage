                                        <p style="text-align:justify">In the years I’ve worked as a programmer, I’ve
                                            noticed, mostly in myself but also in other developers, various behaviors
                                            that make us unproductive. These are usually either low self-esteem, fear of
                                            the unknown, or arrogance, which create the problems. Human characteristics
                                            that, as human experience has shown, when we master them, we make the world
                                            better.</p>

                                        <br/>
                                        <h3>1. I need to learn everything to be a good programmer</h3>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">This can happen when you start your journey as a
                                            programmer. Slightly influenced by the countless movies showing programmers
                                            as centers of knowledge and wisdom, and a bit by the huge amount of
                                            technologies out there, you think you're too insignificant to become a
                                            programmer or that you need to dedicate your life exclusively to it.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">When I finished school and was trying to find my
                                            first job as a programmer, I read all the job listings and the skills
                                            potential employers wanted me to have, and I broke into a cold sweat.
                                            Technologies I had never heard of, terminology that was unknown and
                                            incomprehensible. This was the reason I didn’t continue as a professional
                                            programmer at that time and chose something simpler, like network
                                            technician.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">However, if I had overcome my fears back then and
                                            managed to find a job as a programmer, I would have faced another problem
                                            that many beginners face—the imposter syndrome.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">And indeed, when I started working as a programmer
                                            in 2016, for two years I thought I was just lucky and that soon they would
                                            discover how incompetent I was and fire me. This anxiety made me try to
                                            learn as much as possible. Learn WordPress, learn JavaScript, learn Laravel,
                                            learn C and C++ (as if I needed them as a web developer), learn the
                                            significance of every new buzzword I saw in the programming world.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, I soon realized that all I needed to
                                            do was focus my attention on one language, one framework, and learn the
                                            basic concepts and how I could apply them in my everyday work as a
                                            programmer.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">As programmers, we need to understand that we
                                            can't learn everything. Programming languages, frameworks, and technologies
                                            are so numerous out there that even two lifetimes wouldn’t be enough to
                                            learn them all. We only need to understand that all we need to learn are the
                                            basics, the fundamentals. The client-server model, recursion, SOLID, design
                                            patterns. These concepts are tied to a single technology or language but can
                                            be applied across most technologies and languages.</p>

                                        <br/>
                                        <h3>2. I know everything, I am the best programmer</h3>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, I have never met a programmer with
                                            the arrogant behavior of the all-knowing who is always right. However, it is
                                            another human behavior that we encounter in our daily lives, and sooner or
                                            later, we will encounter it in our profession as well.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">At some point, we may acquire so much programming
                                            knowledge that we begin to believe we are something special. This may even
                                            be reinforced if, in the environment you work in, you always have the
                                            answers and help others with their problems. However, it’s good not to have
                                            illusions.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">We must always have an open mind and listen to the
                                            opinion of someone who may not have the experience or the same knowledge as
                                            we do. A good idea can come even from our local newsagent, who might have
                                            nothing to do with programming. Rejecting an idea to insist on our own
                                            superiority helps no one.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">More important than being right is the ability to
                                            collaborate with others, and this cannot be done if you believe you are
                                            always right or that your opinion is better than others. Collaboration
                                            solves problems, and that's the only thing we want to do as programmers—to
                                            solve problems.</p>

                                        <br/>
                                        <h3>3. This problem is impossible to solve, no one has ever solved it</h3>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">Let’s say you’ve been working as a programmer for
                                            some years, you have self-confidence (but not arrogance), and you are
                                            presented with a problem you’ve never encountered before. It seems
                                            impossible to implement, and you reject it. Congratulations, you just missed
                                            an opportunity to become a better programmer.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">I understand the fear someone might have about the
                                            unknown, but a programmer doesn’t exist to create simple CRUD applications.
                                            After all, even an AI could do that today. A programmer is for the tough
                                            problems. And these are the ones that improve him and make him better.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">Certainly, not all problems can be solved, but we
                                            shouldn’t dismiss even the attempt to solve them. Before you say that you
                                            cannot solve this problem, give it a try. See if others have solved it or
                                            solved part of it. Ask another programmer if they have any ideas. Only when
                                            you reach an absolute dead end should you admit defeat. It’s not a bad
                                            thing. Then say that at this moment, this problem cannot be solved by
                                            me.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align:justify">The process of solving it, or even admitting
                                            defeat, takes you a step forward. It’s no small thing to break out of a
                                            routine of creating simple CRUD applications and do what you were made
                                            for—to solve real problems.</p>
