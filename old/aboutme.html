                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p>
                    Ok, some words about me. My name is Theodoros or Thodoris. It is a Greek name and means "gift by god".
                    But what I really prefer to be calld is Kouleris which is my last name. Anyway, even if I grew up in
                    a Greek Orthodox family I am an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a>.
                    My native language is Greek but I can speak English very well too. I learned English when I was a
                    kid by watching a lot of cartoons on the T.V. and later I improved my English by reading a lot of
                    articles on line about tech and programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in 1982 on September 22nd and astrologists say that my sign is  virgo. I really have the
                    most of the characteristics of a virgo but what I really am is an
                    <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html">INTJ</a>. I was always a geek. I was passing my
                    time by watching cartoons, reading comic books and playing video games. You might say that those
                    things are something that every child does. Indeed, but when you become an adult and you still do
                    the same things is not normal. Anyway, I had my first video game console when I was 7 years old.
                    It was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>. After that I bought some
                    more video game consoles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a>,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Famicom knock-off</a>(very
                    popular in Greece) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a>
                    (Sega Genesis for the US people). Sadly I don't have any of those now. In the year 2010 I bought a
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">Sony PSP</a> and an
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox360">Xbox360</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had my first computer in 1997 and my life change dramatically since then. That year I decided that
                    I want to go to a University that I can learn more about computers. And I did it. In 2000 I went to
                    Technological Education Institute of Lamia where I learned various things not only by the lessons
                    that I attended but also by the people that I met there. I worked as an administrator of the computer
                    lab in the Nurse school and after that I worked for 6 months as a Network technical support staff
                    in <a href="http://www.compuservice.gr/">Compuforce ltd</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next important stop of my life was when I went for my military training. Those may were hard
                    times because of the small amount of sleep that we were getting but great times because all the fun
                    I had with the other soldiers. After my military training I started working again in Compuforce ltd
                    until the end of July 2007 when I resigned. For a short period of time I taught networks, data bases,
                    microprocessors and linux at <a href="http://www.delta-iek.gr">Delta Vocational Training Institute</a>.
                    Since 2009 I worked as a web developer and IT at <a href="http://www.cocoon.gr">Cocoon Ecoclima</a>
                    until 2016 when I resigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that I decided to follow my original dream since I was a student and finally to become a
                    professional programmer. So, I started to study all the basics and I landed a job as a web developer
                    at <a href="https://www.peppercode.gr/">Peppercode</a>. Since then I devoted most of my time on
                    improving my self in programming by learning new technologies and applying programming methodologies
                    at my projects.
                </p>
                <h2>My free time</h2>
                <p>
                    When I have free time I like to program, watch movies, listen to music, read books and comics or
                    play video games. My favorite kind of music is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metal</a>.
                    My favorite bands are Blind Guardian, Rhapsody, Black Sabbath, Dream Evil, Nightwish, Manowar and
                    Cradle of filth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013 I started a small youtube show, reviewing old video games. The name of the show is Greek Gamer
                    and you can find a list of the videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/darkheart220982">here</a>.
                    Unfortunately the show is in Greek language so only people who can understand Greek can view it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mostly my free time is about programming. I usually write small applications in PHP or JAVA. I also
                    like to study how to improve my programming skills.
                    Finally I have two computers.
                </p>
                <h2>The Computers</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Athena:</b> This is my main computer. I spent a lot of time with it. It has 16GB of RAM, an
                    Intel Core i7 7700 at 3.6Gh. The Operating System on this computer is Mint Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Mars:</b> This is my portable computer. It's a Lenovo G50-80 laptop with 8GB of RAM and an i3 4005U CPU.
                    It's a good alternative for my main computer for work and games as well. Although I don't like it,
                    I have installed Windows 10 because in a world where the majority of users use Windows at some point
                    you will need a Windows computer.
                </p>
                <h2>Where do I usually lurk</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday I visit various sites so I can stay in touch with technology and events of the world.<br/>
